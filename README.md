### Project Summary

This project explores and implements different types and architectures of neural networks on microcontrollers, with a focus on optimization and embedded code generation. The goal is to transform Python models developed using frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch into efficient code for microcontrollers, while leveraging hardware accelerators provided by manufacturers. The project will also address simulation to test models before hardware deployment, as well as evaluating the performance, costs, and energy consumption of the deployed solutions.

### Project Objectives

- Study of platforms and code generation tools
  * Exploration of conversion tools (such as TensorFlow Lite, PyTorch Mobile...).
  * Understanding deployment libraries specific to manufacturers.

- Transformation of Python models into embedded code
  * Converting machine learning models into optimized code for microcontrollers.
  * Managing specific constraints (quantization, limited memory).

- Implementation and optimization of models
  * Implementing models like CNN, RNN, MLP, and Transformers.
  * Compression and optimization for performance and energy constraints.

- Simulation of embedded models
  * Using hardware simulators to predict performance before deployment.
  * Functional validation of models on virtual test benches.

- Evaluation and deployment
  * Performance analysis (accuracy, latency, energy consumption).
  * Comparison of results on different hardware architectures.

- Detailed reporting and recommendations
  * Documentation of steps, tools used, results obtained, and limitations.
  * Recommendations for future improvements.
